PyCipher: A simple Encrypter/Decrypter and Vigenere Cipher in Python.
====================================================
- This is a simple program that encodes and/or decodes in a symple cipher and in the Vigenere Cipher, written in Python.

**Running the Cipher:**
```py
python pycipher-simple.py
python pycipher-vigenere.py
```

Simple Encrypter/Decripter
-----------------------------

- Decrypts vowels into encrypted characters
- While simple as it is, it can easily be deciphered without any assistance.
- Interactable interface! No need to re-run the python script.
- 2-in-1 cipher generator!

Vigenere Cipher
-----------------------------

- Accepts Letter keys to decrypt and encrypt messages!
- interactable 2-in-1 cipher generator!
